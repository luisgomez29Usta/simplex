# EKR-SIMPLEX-CALCULATOR

This is a simplex problem calculator for statistics

problems it solves:
  1. maximization
  2. minimization
 
you can use this to draw tables
you need to install
numpy to use this program


data values supported can be in the following forms:
  1. fractions. eg. (2/3)
  2. decimal numbers. eg. 0.5
  3. whole numbers. eg. 100
  
I allowed definition of number of decimals to be used in solution
  
I also added notification for those problems that dont possibly have solution due to wrong formulation of constrains and its values.

clone or download then run:

to install basic requirements

`pip install numpy`

`pip install pandas`

finally you can run the program by running

`python3 simplex.py`

only console usage of the program is available yet

The simplex tableaus are drawn in form of python lists or pandas tables.
